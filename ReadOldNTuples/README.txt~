Resolution : At 1.5 GeV, the resolutions are 1 mm on the radial position, 1.5 mm on the vertical position, 0.5% on the curvature, and 1 mrad on the vertical angle. 

Data used: /unix/muons/g-2/omegaEU/v9_11_00

Ultimately, the aim of the exercise is to investigate how lost muon contamination messes up beam position measurements. The final four numbers will be the difference in the radial/vertical means and width of the all tracker tree with and without scaled lost muons subtracted. 

Cuts all:
