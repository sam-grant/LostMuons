Investigate the high momentum shoulder. Does it contain lost muons (is the log(E/p) cut sufficient).

1) Implement a high energy cut in the momentum regime of lost muons:

   E > 2500 [MeV]
   p > 2300 [MeV]
   
2) Implement a wider lost muon cut
   100 < E [MeV] < 500
   p > 2300 [MeV]

Sudeshna et al: “A selection of 100 MeV < Edep < 500 MeV will remove the low energy glancing muons as well as the low energy decay positrons that fake MIPs. “

Check the difference between the two in momentum space.
